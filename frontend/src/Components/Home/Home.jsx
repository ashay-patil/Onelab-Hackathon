                <p>
                    Deepfakes are hyper-realistic digital falsifications created using advanced artificial intelligence, making it challenging to distinguish them from authentic content. These manipulations can depict individuals saying or doing things they never did, leading to potential misuse in various domains, including politics, entertainment, and personal relationships.
